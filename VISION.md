Personal opinionated software that helps to quickly create, categorize, and break down vague wants/ideas into actionable clear goals. The first customer is ME. I want to build software for ME. And that means really understanding what I want, what my brain likes, and what pitfalls I fall into. And my psychology learnings will be embedded into the site.
